## My Progress

I am currently a Queens U student in ontario. In the past I have done a terrible job of using github to track my work and projects.

With this in mind, I plan to change my ways of failing to use github; I plan on saving all projects I make while learning Rust (even the most basic concepts).

With this in mind. Here are my programming projects...

### Rust
<ol>
  <li value="2">First Cargo Use - <a href="https://github.com/IRennie74/cargo_hello_world_rust">Cargo Hello World</a></li>
  
  <li value="1">First Project - <a href="https://github.com/IRennie74/Hello-World-Rust">Rust Hello World</a></li>
</ol>
